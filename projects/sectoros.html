<h1><b>SectorOS</b></h1>
<p>This is my first big project with over 5000 lines of code. This all started when i made a bootloader to print "Hello World!". Then i wanted to make a fully fledged os like MS-DOS. I saw a series of tutorial on how to make a os <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M">[Playlist]</a>. I followed the tutorials and made some changes of my own.</p>
